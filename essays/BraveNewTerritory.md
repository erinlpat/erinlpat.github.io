I know the krebs cycle like the back of my hand. I could tell you the ins and outs of the functions of hemoglobin and how it lets us all breathe the air. I even know why we have air at all, and how we evolved to use it. I know all of these things and yet I have never felt more incapable in my entire life. I have spent the last four years endlessly pouring over journals, textbooks, and articles about nearly every field in biology. Taking countless classes, exams, and labs in the field that I am extremely passionate about. Now here I am, stubbornly struggling through completely new territory in software engineering, algorithms, and bioinformatics in addition to my biology major. So why did I decide to study computer science in my final year at university? 

As I dove head first into biochemistry, genetics, epidemiology, and more, I began to notice how intertwined the natural sciences have become with computer sciences. Where evolutionary biologists used to rely on physical morphology to study how traits passed on and changed over time, geneticists today can use computer programs to look at the exact pattern of billions nucleotides that create our genetic makeup. We can even use AI to predict 3D protein structures and folds, something unheard of until only three years ago. Computer science and the natural sciences, particularly biology, have become irreversably intertwined. 

I believe that the future of every field of the natural sciences lies in its relationship with computer science and how it will make use of the new age of technology unfolding in front of us. In this class I hope to develop my skills in software engineering that pertain to data analysis and and bioinformatics so that I may better understand this relationship and begin to contribute to it myself.
