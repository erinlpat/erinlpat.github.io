# Experience With IntelliJ and ESLint
After my first week of using IntelliJ I am proud that I have learned to use a new environment. However, I am still not fully confident and I am looking forward to continuing to improve. Before this unit, I had been using Visual Studio Code as my primary environment outside of class and for some things within class as well. Now that we have been introduced to IntelliJ, I am trying to fully transition to it without using Visual Studio Code to aid me. Some things I enjoy about the new environment include the use of class coding standards, its integration with GitHub, and its keyboard shortcuts. 

Having the class coding standards directly within IntelliJ makes it much easier to be sure I am following the standards of the course which is particularly important with our athletic learning style. Knowing I am formatting my code the way the instructors want it helps immensely with peace of mind during timed WODs and regular in-class activities. I can focus on the code itself and my desired outcomes instead of stressing about formatting with IntelliJ. Though achieving that coveted green checkmark may be difficult sometimes, it is always worth it knowing that my code lives up to class coding standards. 

IntelliJ’s direct integration with GitHub is incredibly helpful in constructing repositories for class projects and for my personal portfolio. I find it much more comfortable to write my code in IntelliJ before pushing it to GitHub rather than writing directly in GitHub itself. This allows me more freedom to make mistakes, edit, and save things for later. Perhaps the most important part of having my GitHub repositories in IntelliJ is the debugging features. When I code directly in GitHub, it is far more difficult to spot problems in my code and fix them. IntelliJ makes the debugging and formatting process much easier and faster.

However, one thing I do not enjoy about IntelliJ is the console. While I never expected to say this, I prefer the live updating console we used in JSFiddle. It allowed me to see what parts of my code worked and which parts the program was getting stuck on live while I coded during the WODs. With IntelliJ, I have to go back and forth between a browser and IntelliJ in order to check my output because the built-in console often does not work within the environment. Other than this, I am fully satisfied with IntelliJ.

# Importance of Universality
The most important thing working with IntelliJ has taught me is the importance of Universality. Because it is such a constantly changing field with so many different languages and environments, computer science needs universality more than any other field of science. With universal standards, programmers, regardless of what language they use or when they began programming, can understand a widespread and highly varied range of information. It is thanks to universal standards being upheld that we as a community in computer science can continue to work together within our niches to push technology forward even as we continue to diversify into many different fields, some of which didn’t even exist a year ago! I believe that continuing to uphold coding standards is the key to supporting the ever-evolving field of computer science.

# Conclusions
Learning how to use IntelliJ and ESLint has been an extremely valuable experience. I can tell even now that it will be of great use in the future. As I aim for a career in computer science, being able to comply to coding standards will be an invaluable core skill I can bring with me from my time in ICS314. IntelliJ and ESLint have not only enhanced my coding proficiency but also instilled in me the significance of adapting to new environments and embracing universal coding standards. Transitioning to using IntelliJ has been a significant step towards honing my skills and aligning with industry-standard practices. The integration with GitHub, adherence to class coding standards, and efficient use of keyboard shortcuts have streamlined my coding process and all in all have made me a more skilled programmer. As I continue to refine my skills and pursue a career in computer science, the lessons learned from this experience will serve as a solid foundation for future endeavors.
