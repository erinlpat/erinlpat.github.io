summary: "A Coqui Frog sound sensor that detects the presence of the invasive species."
---

The Coqui Frog Sensor is a project I am assisting with in the UH Manoa Entomology lab. 

In this project I built a Coqui frog sensor on a bread board and transfered it to a circuit board. The machine senses the Coqui Frogs' call and alerts us to its presence in the vicinity of the sensor. It is used to track the invasive population. I also assist with the machine learning and programming of the sensor in python under the guidance of a graduate student.

By building the Coqui Frog Sensor, I have gained experience in machine learning, working with python, and circuitry.
