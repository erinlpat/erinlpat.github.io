The Coqui Frog Sensor is an ongoing project I am assisting with in the UH Manoa Entomology lab. 

In this project I am assisting in building a Coqui frog sensor on a bread board and I will later transfer the finished product to a proper circuit board. The machine senses the Coqui Frogs' call and alerts us to its presence in the vicinity of the sensor. It is used to track the invasive population. I also assist with the machine learning and programming of the sensor in python under the guidance of a graduate student. 

By building the Coqui Frog Sensor, I have gained experience in machine learning, working with python, and circuitry. This project is still in its very early stages and currently ongoing but it is the most relevant project I have worked on up to date. Working in the lab, along with the fieldwork, is a great experience and the hands-on style has helped me progress my skills in programming and machine learning at an unprecendented speed. Once I have more material on this project I will continue to update my portfolio.
